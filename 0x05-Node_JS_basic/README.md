## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Execute JavaScript code using Node.js.
- Work with Node.js modules.
- Use Node.js to read and manipulate files.
- Access environment variables and command-line arguments using `process`.
- Create and manage HTTP servers using Node.js and Express.js.
- Implement advanced routing in Express.js.
- Utilize ES6 features in Node.js with Babel.
- Speed up development using Nodemon.

Tasks
0. Executing basic JavaScript with Node.js
Create a function displayMessage that prints a string to STDOUT.

1. Using Process stdin
Create a program 1-stdin.js that prompts for user input and prints a message based on the input.

2. Reading a File Synchronously with Node.js
Create a function countStudents that reads and processes a CSV file synchronously.

3. Reading a File Asynchronously with Node.js
Modify countStudents to read and process the CSV file asynchronously, returning a Promise.

4. Creating a Simple HTTP Server
Create an HTTP server that listens on port 1245 and displays a message for any endpoint.

5. Creating a Complex HTTP Server
Extend the HTTP server to handle different routes, including reading and displaying student data from the CSV file.

6. Creating a Simple HTTP Server with Express.js
Install Express and create a simple HTTP server that responds with a message for any endpoint.

7. Creating a Complex HTTP Server with Express.js
Recreate the complex HTTP server using Express.js to handle different routes and display student data.

8. Organizing a Complex HTTP Server with Express.js
Organize your Express.js server into separate controllers, routes, and utilities. Use ES6 features and Babel for transpiling.

Provided Files
database.csv: Contains sample student data.
package.json: Manages project dependencies.
babel.config.js: Configures Babel for ES6.
.eslintrc.js: Configures ESLint for linting JavaScript code.
